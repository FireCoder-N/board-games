# Magic Duel

#### *Whenever powerful wizards meet, duel is inevitable.*

Everyone prepares and casts their most complex spells, in an attempt to defeat their opponents and obtain fame and wealth. Nowadays, clashes between wizards are not a common event, but do still take place in the various magic tournaments. 

You as well are an aspiring wizard, participating in such a tournament, hoping to obtain the title of *the best wizard*. 

## Setup
<ins>To play this game you only need a regular deck of cards.</ins> Depending on the number of players, you are free to use more decks, as needed.

- First of all, decide how many points does a wizard need to win the game.(This is roughly equal to the number of rounds the game will last). 
- Remove from the deck(s) any special cards except from the Jokers.
- Deal 7 cards to each player. 
- Also remove from the deck as many cards as the number of players. Place them face-down on the table. This is known as `the deck of Risk`.
- You will also need to use one special card and shuffle it into the rest of the deck. This is known as `the deck of Advantege`. (most standard decks of cards do include such an extra, special card. Be sure to use only one special card, no matter the number of decks.)
- The order of playing is also agreed upon (or randomly decided).

## Gameplay
Each player, in their turn plays one combination (explained in the following paragraph) from their hand face-down.

Before doing so, the player **may** discard one card onto the deck of Risk, face-down. If they do so, they are obliged to play their cards face-up this turn.

### End of the turn
After all the players have played their spells once each, the turn ends. The played cards are turned over and the player with the stronger combination wins the round and gathers in the trick (places it face-down in front of them).

Afterwards, the players draw, <ins>following the turn order</ins>, cards from either of the before-mentioned decks until they have  cards in hand. The player who won the round draws one extra card of advantage and plays first in the new round.

## Combinations
- **Cantrip:** a single card.<br>
In order to define the winner, the order of cards is as follows:<br>
`A < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K`<br>
There is one exception to that rule: <ins>if an ace (A) and a king (K) are played at the same round, the ace wins the round.</ins><br>In case of a tie use the symbols of the cards: `♦ < ♥ < ♠ < ♣`.

- **Codu**, aka "the Double": 2 cards of the same value.<br>
This combination wins any single-card spell. Among 2 or more codus the same rules as above are applied.

- **Thrack**, aka "breaking attack": 3 cards of the same value.<br>
The exact same rules apply.

- **RAQUAV / X-RAQAV**, aka "finishing move": 4 cards of the same value.<br>
The exact same rules apply.

- **Badef**, aka "abjuration magic": One Joker card.<br>
Competing against any cantrip this combination always wins. Competing against any other combination among the above, the round is considered as tied and the players must replay immidiately, without gathering in the tricks or drawing any cards.
<br>

- **Jokulme**, aka "ultimate mahou": Two Joker cards.<br>
Wins any combination. On the very rare occassion that 2 or more jokulme spells are cast, the 1st one wins the round.

## Endgame
